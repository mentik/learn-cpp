## Learning C++

This repository is being used for my C++ learning journey.

Let's learn C++ together...

## Requirements

- Linux/WSL
- g++ >= 14.2.0 [https://gcc.gnu.org/]

    Compiler, support C++ 20.

    ```sh
    g++ --version
    ```
- gdb >= 16.3 [https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/]

    For debugging, support C++ 20.

    ```sh
    gdb --version
    ```

- VSCode

    With this setup, simply open a CPP file, run, the `.bin` file will be built and result on the console.

## Manual Run Example

### Compile

```sh
g++ learn/hello-world/hello-world.cpp -o learn/hello-world/hello-world.cpp
```

### Run 

```sh
./learn/hello-world/hello-world.bin
```
